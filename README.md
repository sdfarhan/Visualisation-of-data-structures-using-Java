# Visualisation-of-data-structures-using-Java
In this application we have tried to visualize different types of data structures.



We have a System application which can show the visualization of commonly used data structure entities, majorly the delete and insertion options. By using the user data to make arrays, stacks, queues etc. 

Introduction
Data Structures and their entities due to the wide use of these, students get confused so our idea is to develop a mechanism to make sure everyone understands these by simple yet useful indications graphically. For example a student may generally face a bit of problem in understanding the topics such as a Binary tree, AVL tree, AVL Search tree, similarly to differentiate the difference between the stack and a queue. To overcome the following problems as students are not well verse with, a simple system application which is based on the algorithm which readily takes the input from the user and then knows how to implement it to have a representation of the data types. Moreover, this will even help to provide a simple language, by which students can write their own algorithms and get the results in animated. The key objectives are 
a. To provide the visualization for arrays, queues, stack etc.
b. To provide with certain algorithm in which user can enter their own set of data to processing.
c. To not only use this for inserting but for deleting them also.

How to run this app!!!!!!!
Just download the Visualization.jar file and run it. It will run if you have installed Java on your local machine.


Actual code of this prject is in code/src directory.
The main file of application is Main.java
